# ADR-0001: Backend Technology Stack Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to select a backend technology stack for our application that provides:

- High performance and low resource consumption
- Fast startup times and simple deployment
- Cross-platform compatibility for native and desktop deployment
- Strong ecosystem with mature tooling
- Good developer experience with familiar technology
- Simple scalability patterns

The application will be deployed across multiple platforms including web services, desktop applications, and potentially mobile backends. Team familiarity and deployment simplicity are key factors.

## Decision

We will use **Go (Golang)** as our backend technology stack.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Java with Quarkus and GraalVM

**Pros:**

- Mature Java ecosystem and extensive libraries
- Strong enterprise tooling and patterns
- Excellent IDE support and debugging
- Large talent pool
- Comprehensive testing frameworks

**Cons:**

- Complex build pipeline (2-5 minute native compilation)
- GraalVM reflection configuration complexity
- Difficult native image debugging
- JVM memory overhead in non-native mode
- Over-engineered for simple applications
- Steep learning curve for Quarkus-specific patterns

### 2. Rust

**Pros:**

- Exceptional performance and memory safety
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Growing ecosystem with excellent package manager (Cargo)
- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Strong type system

**Cons:**

- Steep learning curve and complex syntax
- Limited enterprise adoption and tooling
- Smaller talent pool
- Longer development cycles due to strict compiler
- Less mature web framework ecosystem

### 3. Node.js (TypeScript)

**Pros:**

- Large ecosystem (npm)
- Good developer experience with TypeScript
- Fast development cycles
- Unified language with frontend (if using JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Excellent JSON handling

**Cons:**

- Single-threaded event loop limitations
- Higher memory consumption
- Runtime type checking overhead
- Complex dependency management
- Less predictable performance characteristics

### 4. Python

**Pros:**

- Rapid development and prototyping
- Extensive libraries for data science and ML
- Large developer community
- Simple syntax and readability
- Strong ecosystem

**Cons:**

- Slower runtime performance
- GIL limitations for CPU-bound tasks
- Higher memory consumption
- Deployment complexity
- Runtime dependency management issues

## Rationale for Go

### Performance Characteristics

- Instant startup times (no virtual machine overhead)
- Minimal memory footprint (typically 5-20MB for web services)
- Excellent performance for concurrent workloads with goroutines
- Efficient garbage collector with low pause times
- Compiled to native machine code

### Developer Experience

- Team already familiar with Go syntax and idioms
- Sub-second compilation times enable rapid development cycles
- Simple, explicit error handling reduces debugging time
- Strong static typing catches errors at compile time
- Minimal cognitive overhead with straightforward syntax

### Ecosystem and Tooling

- Mature standard library covers most common use cases
- Excellent HTTP server and client libraries built-in
- Growing ecosystem with quality third-party packages
- Built-in testing framework and benchmarking tools
- Excellent tooling: gofmt, go mod, go vet, race detector

### Operational Benefits

- Single binary deployment with zero dependencies
- Trivial cross-compilation for multiple platforms
- Excellent Docker integration with minimal image sizes
- Built-in profiling and runtime metrics
- Simple deployment and operations

## Consequences

### Positive

- Instant startup times eliminate cold start penalties
- Minimal resource consumption reduces infrastructure costs
- High developer productivity with familiar technology and fast feedback loops
- Excellent performance characteristics for concurrent workloads
- Simple deployment model reduces operational complexity
- Cross-platform compilation supports multi-target deployment strategy

### Negative

- Smaller ecosystem compared to Java or Node.js
- More verbose error handling compared to exception-based languages
- Limited generics capabilities (though improving)
- Fewer enterprise-specific frameworks and patterns
- Package management less mature than npm or Maven

### Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk:** Third-party library availability
  - **Mitigation:** Leverage robust standard library; evaluate packages carefully
- **Risk:** Team scaling with Go-specific knowledge
  - **Mitigation:** Go's simplicity makes onboarding straightforward
- **Risk:** Enterprise integration patterns
  - **Mitigation:** Focus on simple, composable designs over complex frameworks

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1:** Set up Go project structure with standard layout
2. **Phase 2:** Implement core business logic and HTTP APIs
3. **Phase 3:** Add database integration and persistence layer
4. **Phase 4:** Implement authentication and authorization
5. **Phase 5:** Add monitoring, logging, and production readiness

## Metrics for Success

- Startup time: < 10ms for application boot
- Memory usage: < 20MB for basic web service
- Build time: < 5 seconds for full compilation
- Developer productivity: Code-compile-test cycle under 10 seconds
- Performance: Handle 10,000+ requests/second with low latency

# ADR-0002: Frontend Technology Stack Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to select a frontend technology stack for our application that provides:

- Cross-platform deployment: web, mobile (iOS/Android), and desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- High performance with smooth 60fps animations on all platforms
- Single codebase maintenance to reduce development overhead
- Modern developer experience with fast build times and hot reload
- Strong typing system for maintainability and error prevention
- Native performance and platform integration capabilities

The frontend will serve as the primary user interface across multiple platforms and needs to provide consistent, native-quality user experience while maintaining a single codebase.

## Decision

We will use **Dart with Flutter framework** as our frontend technology stack.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. TypeScript with Bun runtime and Qwik framework

**Pros:**

- Excellent web performance with resumability model
- Fast build times with Bun runtime
- Modern TypeScript development experience
- Server-side rendering capabilities
- Cutting-edge performance optimizations

**Cons:**

- Web-only deployment (no native mobile/desktop)
- Bleeding-edge technology with limited ecosystem
- Small community and fewer resources
- Requires separate development for native platforms
- Learning curve for resumability concepts

### 2. React Native + React Web

**Pros:**

- Code sharing between mobile and web
- Large ecosystem and community
- Mature tooling and development patterns
- Strong job market and talent pool
- Excellent debugging tools

**Cons:**

- No desktop support without additional tools
- Performance limitations compared to native
- Bridge overhead between JavaScript and native code
- Complex navigation and state management across platforms
- Different codebases for web and native still required

### 3. Electron + React/Vue (for desktop) + separate mobile

**Pros:**

- Full desktop integration capabilities
- Familiar web development patterns
- Large ecosystem of web technologies
- Good debugging and development tools

**Cons:**

- High memory consumption and slow startup
- Poor performance compared to native applications
- Requires separate mobile development
- Large application bundle sizes
- Battery drain and resource usage issues

### 4. Native development (Swift/Kotlin + web frontend)

**Pros:**

- Best possible performance on each platform
- Full access to platform-specific APIs
- Optimal user experience on each platform
- No framework limitations

**Cons:**

- Multiple codebases to maintain
- Significantly higher development and maintenance costs
- Different skill sets required for each platform
- Inconsistent feature parity across platforms
- Longer development cycles

## Rationale for Dart + Flutter

### Cross-Platform Unity

- **Single Codebase:** One codebase deploys to web, iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Consistent UI:** Identical user experience across all platforms
- **Shared Business Logic:** All application logic maintained in one place
- **Platform Integration:** Access to native APIs through platform channels

### Performance Characteristics

- **Native Compilation:** Compiles to native ARM/x64 code on mobile and desktop
- **60fps Animations:** Smooth animations powered by Skia graphics engine
- **Fast Startup:** No JavaScript bridge or virtual machine overhead
- **Efficient Memory Usage:** Garbage-collected but optimized for mobile constraints

### Developer Experience

- **Strong Typing:** Dart's sound null safety prevents entire classes of runtime errors
- **Hot Reload:** Sub-second code changes with state preservation
- **Excellent Tooling:** First-class IDE support in VS Code and Android Studio
- **Comprehensive Framework:** Batteries-included with routing, state management, animations

### Ecosystem and Maturity

- **Google Backing:** Long-term support and investment from Google
- **Growing Ecosystem:** Rapidly expanding package ecosystem (pub.dev)
- **Production Ready:** Used by Google Ads, Alibaba, BMW, and other major companies
- **Strong Community:** Active community with extensive documentation and resources

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Single Codebase Maintenance:** Dramatically reduced development and maintenance costs
- **Consistent User Experience:** Identical interface and behavior across all platforms
- **Native Performance:** True 60fps animations and responsive interactions
- **Rapid Development:** Hot reload and comprehensive tooling enable fast iteration
- **Future-Proof:** Platform support continues expanding (embedded, automotive, etc.)
- **Strong Foundation:** Sound type system and modern language features

### Negative

- **Learning Curve:** New language (Dart) and framework concepts to master
- **App Store Distribution:** Mobile apps require App Store/Play Store approval processes
- **Web Performance:** Larger initial bundle size compared to optimized web frameworks
- **Platform Limitations:** Some platform-specific features require native code integration
- **Talent Pool:** Smaller developer community compared to React/JavaScript ecosystem

### Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk:** Team unfamiliarity with Dart language
  - **Mitigation:** Dart's similarity to other languages makes transition manageable
- **Risk:** Flutter ecosystem gaps for specialized use cases
  - **Mitigation:** Active package ecosystem; ability to write platform-specific code when needed
- **Risk:** Google dependency for long-term support
  - **Mitigation:** Flutter is open source; strong industry adoption provides sustainability
- **Risk:** Web performance compared to specialized web frameworks
  - **Mitigation:** Flutter web performance continues improving; focus on mobile-first approach

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1:** Set up Flutter development environment and project structure
2. **Phase 2:** Create core UI components and design system
3. **Phase 3:** Implement application navigation and routing
4. **Phase 4:** Add platform-specific integrations and native features
5. **Phase 5:** Optimize for each platform and prepare for distribution

## Metrics for Success

- **Hot Reload Time:** < 1 second for code changes
- **Build Time:** < 2 minutes for release builds across all platforms
- **App Size:** < 30MB for mobile apps, < 100MB for desktop
- **Performance:** Consistent 60fps animations on all target devices
- **Development Velocity:** Single feature implemented across all platforms simultaneously
- **User Experience:** Platform-appropriate look and feel with shared functionality

## Platform Deployment Strategy

- **Development:** Start with mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- **Web Deployment:** Progressive Web App with offline capabilities
- **Distribution:** App stores for mobile, direct download/package managers for desktop
- **Testing:** Automated testing across all platforms in CI/CD pipeline
